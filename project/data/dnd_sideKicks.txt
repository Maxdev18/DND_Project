## Gorlock the Destroyer
Gorlock the Destroyer is a name whispered in fear across the shattered kingdoms of the north. Once a chieftain of a forgotten barbarian tribe, Gorlock made a pact with an ancient elemental force buried beneath the scorched earth. His towering form and unstoppable rage are matched only by the raw fury of the storms he commands. With every village razed and stronghold reduced to rubble, Gorlock moves with purpose—seeking vengeance for a betrayal lost to time, and forging a legacy carved in flame and ruin. Few survive an encounter with him, and those who do speak of eyes glowing like molten lava and a voice like cracking thunder.

## Maximus Decimus Meridius the Gladiator
Maximus Decimus Meridius, once a noble general of a vast empire, now walks the blood-soaked sands of the arena as a gladiator without equal. Betrayed by the corrupt elite and stripped of title and family, Maximus lives for battle and honor. Though enslaved, his indomitable will and martial brilliance have inspired rebellion in both slaves and citizens. Armed with steel and fueled by purpose, he rises each day as a symbol of resistance. The arena may be his prison, but the roar of the crowd is his war drum—and his enemies know the ring is his kingdom.

## Steve the Magician
At first glance, Steve the Magician might seem like an eccentric jester with an affinity for fireworks and rabbits in hats—but beneath the flamboyant robes and playful charm lies one of the most unpredictable wizards in the realm. Self-taught through centuries-old scrolls, mirror worlds, and a few questionable deals with arcane tricksters, Steve channels chaotic magic with a flair for the dramatic. His spells often leave both friend and foe dumbfounded, if not slightly singed. Some say he's a genius, others say he's mad—but when the skies split and reality bends, it's Steve who takes a bow while the universe rearranges itself behind him.
